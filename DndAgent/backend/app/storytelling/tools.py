# We will define tools that can be bound to our agents.
# These need to be initialized with access to the actual subsystems (Memory, Rules).
# Since tools are often static functions or need specific setup, we can use a factory or closure pattern, 
# or just simple functions if we pass context.

# However, standard @tool decorators work best with global or injected state.
# For simplicity, we'll define a class to hold the tools which gets initialized with the subsystems.
